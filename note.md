## An Ellipsoid is also an oracle!

## Multiplier-less FIR filter design using Convex 	

multipliers are expensive
canonical signed digit representation
fixed #non-zero

Difficulties:
1. NP-hard
2. discretization is non-uniform
3. Constraints are too tight

But...
1. The relaxed problem is convex!
2. The nearby CSD can be obtained easily.
